# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis for the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis was to determine how many retiring employees there were based off their titles, and how many of those employees would qualify to participate in the mentorship program. Retiring employees would be those born between 1952 and 1955 while those who qualify for the mentorship program are born in the year 1965.

## Results

Deliverable 1):

  * Major Point 1: The departments that will be most affected by the "silver tsunami" are the Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, and Staff titles with over 10,000 employees. The titles that aren't as affected are the Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager titles with less than 5,000 employees and the Manager position being only 2 employees.

  * Major Point 2: The total number of retiring employees is "90,398."

Deliverable 2):

  * Major Point 1: Based off the number of number of employees that are eligible for the mentorship program, the Staff and Engineer departments will have many mentors to help develop them into more highly trained and productive employees due to the high number of Senior Staff and Senior Engineer employees.

  * Major Point 2: There are a total of "1,549" employees that qualify for the mentorship program.

## Summary

The total amount of roles that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact is "90,398." 

Based off the total number of employees at Pewlett Hackard and how many people the mentorship program eligible retirement-ready employees can train for each department, I would say that they would have a difficult time mentoring the next generation of employees. The two departments that would do better than most are the Staff department and the Engineer department as there many eligible mentors in the senior positions.
